            <h1>Designing a modern Web Application </h1>
            <p>I worked as the full stack developer to develop a modern Web Application for Bakery. I took the brand in a bold new direction, with a focus on longevity.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h1>The problem</h1>
                <p>In 2023, Bakery began a project to build an entirely new Web Application with front and backend to deal with the increase in sales. The old Web Application was built in PHP and HTML 3, and there were a number of user experience problems to solve in the process of moving the Web Application to React with an ASP.Net Core back-end The primary goals for the project were reducing barriers to collaboration and making the platform easier for new and advance users.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h1>Designing the front-end</h1>
                <p>To bring the old Web Application to modern standards React was chosen as its flexibility can offer a huge advantage. In order to pick the aesthetics and user experience across the Web Application talks with the client and users was important.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h1>Desiging the back-end</h1>
                <p>The reason ASP.NET Core was chosen it that its Cross-platform and ranks among the fastest web frameworks and as well to update the service infrastructure. A lot of the emphasis was placed on the shopping cart to handle lots of orders.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h1>Deploying the Web Application</h1>
                <p>Microsoft Azure was chosen to deploy the Web Application both front-end and back-end on as an advantage was levelling the global infrastructure provided by Microsoft to seamlessly expand the business into other geographies as well as use autoscaling and scalability to meet peak demands of the business without provisioning for excess capacity.</p>
